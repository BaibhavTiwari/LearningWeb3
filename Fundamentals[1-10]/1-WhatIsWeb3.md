### What is web 3.0 ?
Web3, short for Web 3.0, refers to the next generation Internet, aimed at distribution and freedom in all aspects of online interactions. Web3 is often associated with the development of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized social media platforms, and other innovative applications. It seeks to create a more inclusive, transparent, and user-centric internet experience, where individuals have greater sovereignty over their digital lives.

#### Different Generations of Web and their applications.
<ul>

- `Web 1.0` was characterized by static web pages and no user participation.
- `Web 2.0` provided good content and user engagement.
- `Web 3.0` introduced technology policy and decentralization principles.

#### The various Components and Concepts associated with web 3.0 

- **Blockchain:** Web3 is based on blockchain technology, a distributed and immutable ledger that records transactions across multiple computers. It provides transparency, security and reliability by eliminating the need for centralized control.


- **Cryptocurrency:** Web3 embraces cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing secure and unlimited digital transactions. These cryptocurrencies act like traditional currencies in the Web3 ecosystem and facilitate various digital applications (dApps).


- **Decentralized Applications(dApps):** dApps are applications that run on networks such as blockchain platforms. Their purpose is to remove the middleman, increase transparency and give users control over their data. dApps cover many areas including finance, distribution, social and gaming.


- **Smart Contracts:** Web3 uses smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with predefined rules defined in the blockchain. After the conditions are determined, these contracts automatically become operational and work uninterruptedly.


- **Interoperability:** Web3 offers interoperability by enabling different blockchains and dApps to communicate and interact with each other.Interoperability enables the exchange of assets and information across multiple platforms and facilitates collaboration between different projects.


- **User Control and Data Ownership:** Web3 gives users control of their digital identity, data and online interactions. Aiming to shift power from centralized sources to individuals, it allows users to control their personal data and choose how it is accessed and used.
