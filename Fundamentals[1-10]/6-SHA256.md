### SHA-256 ‚öíÔ∏è
SHA-256 Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit is a cryptographic hash function that belongs to the SHA-2 Secure Hash Algorithm 2 family. It is widely used in various cryptographic applications and serves as a foundational component of many blockchain technologies, including Bitcoin. Published in 2001, it was a joint effort between the NSA and NIST to introduce a successor to the SHA 1 family, which was slowly losing strength against brute force attacks.

The significance of the 256 in the name stands for the final hash digest value, i.e. irrespective of the size of plaintext/cleartext, the hash value will always be 256 bits.

<b>Heres a detailed explanation of SHA-256 </b>

1. `Purpose:` SHA-256 is designed to take an input message of any size and produce a fixed-size 256-bit hash value. Its primary purpose is to ensure data integrity, where even a small change in the input message will result in a significantly different output hash value. It is a one-way function, meaning it is computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the original message from the hash value. 
2. `Algorithm and Operations:` The SHA-256 algorithm operates on 32-bit words and involves several rounds of bitwise logical operations, such as AND, OR, XOR, as well as modular addition and right rotations. The algorithm uses a series of constants and functions to transform the input message block by block. 
3. `Padding:` To process messages of arbitrary length, SHA-256 applies padding rules. The message is divided into fixed-size blocks, and additional bits are added to ensure the final block is a complete multiple of 512 bits. Padding includes appending a 1 bit, followed by a sequence of 0 bits, and finally, adding the length of the original message as a 64-bit big-endian integer. 
4. `Compression:` Function SHA-256 employs a compression function that combines each message block with the previous hash value to produce an intermediate hash value. The compression function involves multiple rounds of mixing and transformation operations to ensure the hash value is influenced by every part of the message.
5. `Security:` SHA-256 is considered a secure cryptographic hash function. It is designed to be resistant to various cryptographic attacks, including pre-image attacks, second pre-image attacks, and collision attacks. However, the security of SHA-256 relies on the assumption that no practical method exists to break the underlying mathematical principles upon which it is based. 
6. `Applications:` SHA-256 has various applications in computer security and cryptography including 
<ul>

- Data Integrity SHA-256 can verify the integrity of transmitted or stored data by comparing the computed hash value with the original hash value. If the hash values match, it indicates that the data has not been altered. 
- Password Storage SHA-256, along with other hashing algorithms, is used to securely store passwords.
